 ## Overview

This is a simple IPython notebook in which there is performed Exploratory Data analysis on various datasets, Forecasting and Machine Learning implementation to study the COVID-19 outbreak, impact and spread using model evaluation.Extraction of important factors that impact transmission rate like temperature, humidity, population, and sun-hours with feature engineering after modeling is done at the later half of the notebook.

## Motivation
Beneficial to concerned client(s) desiring to have a detailed analysis of the present outbreak to have essence of present situation in order to discover and analyze the trend, behavior, responses to various factors affecting the market and invent , strategize precautionary measures for any future pandemic like this.

## Technical Aspect
This project is divided into some sections like:

1. To study SARS-CoV-2 outbreak with the help of some basic visualizationsâ€™ techniques.
2. To Perform predictions and Time Series forecasting in order to study the impact and spread of the SARS-CoV-2 in coming days.
3. To study some important factors that impact transmission rate of SARS-CoV-2 like Air Transmission, Relative humidity., Temperature.
4. To study the responses of countries to SARS-CoV-2 i.e. to classify the changes in the number of infections in different countries, hoping to find out the factors that affect  the country's ability to respond to it.
5. To have a sensible study to classify the trend of the number of infected people under the influence of different factors, and then modify the policy according to the trend of the expected number of infected people.
6. To analyze Growth Factor & Inflection.
7. To have an Exploratory Data analysis, Forecasting and implementing the Machine Learning Models wherever needed.

## Prerequisities
The Code is written in Python 3.7. If you don't have Python installed you can find it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip.

## To Do
1. Convert the app to run without any internet connection, i.e. __PWA__.
2. Add a better vizualization chart to display the predictions.
3. Deploying this project to a web app using heroku.
